# Facial_Emotion_detector
This is code in which we use normal cnn trained model to detect the emotion of the person through facial expression.
It is always better to use Ubuntu in which we can create own new environment and then download all the dependencies in that location
so the code will be very concise and don not interact with the other system libraries.
